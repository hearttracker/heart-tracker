Based on a UX/UI-concept we prototyped an app designed for simplifying tracking of CVD-patient's at home-measurements. The app includes both a frontend for the patient, where he can enter his health data from home and a dashboard for the doctor, where he can see an overview of all of his assigned patients' data and add datapoints/treatments/allergies for each patient.
